# HTML study of Right To Left ordered characters or words

## Starting question:
		  I was wondering if there was an html analogue to the unicode right to left "technique".
			  (here's the totally cool URL to that: <a target="blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rtlo-in-hacking/">https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/rtlo-in-hacking/</a>
     I decided to do a quick grok of the internet and try a few things.
		  		  
##Approach:

I searched a lot of RTL and internationalization pages, and tried their techniquesto see how to get the characters or failing that - the words to be in right to left order - wrapping appropriately and tried them above with varying results (below).

##Conclusion: 

It doesn't seem to be directly translatable.  One thought late in the experiment was this: scour the RTL languages unicode for certain characters that might look like LTR characters and then work it.  Likely will look pretty wonky and not as effective as the windows unicode technique that inspired all this.  Nonetheless, it may be the subject of a future grok.
